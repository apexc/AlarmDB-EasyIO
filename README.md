W
hat is AlarmDB?
It is a Web app which extends functionality of your EasyIO FG, FS, FW controllers and will make controllers to have alarm management system the way modern BMS systems do with no extra cost. So more functions with same cost! Happy days!

This instruction manual will guide you trough how to install and use alarm management app an kit in to your EasyIO products.

This project is a branch of the original AlarmDB project which was ported to EasyIO controllers so FG, FS controller can act as AlarmDB servers/clients and FW controllers can be clients only.

Sedona Kit made for FG,FS,FW controllers lets you push alarms to server(s) directly from your programming app locally or across the TCP/IP network. Same CPT tool is used so no new programming needs to be to learned.
